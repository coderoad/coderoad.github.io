CodeRoad tutorial configurations can be set in the *package.json* config.

```json
{
  "config": {
      "testDir": "tutorial",
      "testSuffix": ".spec.js",
      "testRunner": "mocha-coderoad",
      "edit": true
  }
}
```

This section will likely expand in the future. For now, let's go over some of the configurations.

#### testDir

The relative path to the unit test directory. This makes writing unit tests paths easier.

#### testSuffix

The common suffix for unit tests. Also making writing unit test paths shorter.

#### testRunner

Specified test runner. Currently only *mocha-coderoad* is available.

#### edit

If set to true, *Atom-CodeRoad* will allow users to submit issues or submit markdown pull requests. You will also need to specify "repository" & "bugs" in your *package.json* file. See an [example config file](https://github.com/coderoad/coderoad-functional-school/blob/master/package.json).
