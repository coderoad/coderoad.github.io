CodeRoad tutorials are written in Github Flavored Markdown, then parsed into a *coderoad.json* file when you run `> coderoad build`.

### Markdown

Each level of header indicates a different section, followed by a description.

* `#`   Info
* `##` Page
* `+`   Task

As an example:

```markdown
# Tutorial Title
A description of your tutorial

## Page One Title
A description of page one

+ A description of task one

+ A description of task two

## Page Two Title
A description of page two

etc.
```
