Make sure your tutorial is ready and user tested before publishing to NPM.

In the future this process will be further simplified by `> coderoad publish [version]`.

### Completing your *package.json*

* "name" - beginning with *coderoad-*
* "description" - about your tutorial
* "author" or "authors" information
* "keywords" - about your tutorial
* "repository" - if added, *Atom-CodeRoad* can allow edits
* "bugs" - if added, *Atom-CodeRoad* can provide a link to your github issues
* "dependencies" - including your test runner, and test framework tools
* "config" - see [config](#config)

See an [example](https://github.com/coderoad/coderoad-functional-school/blob/master/package.json) of a complete *package.json* file.

### Versioning

Versioning is handled by:

* the *package.json* declared "version"
* the [git tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)

      > git tag 0.1.0
      > git push --tags

Try to make sure the two specified versions match.

### Publishing to NPM

Publishing to NPM is easy, which may be one of the reasons why the NPM registry is so crowded with packages. Please ensure your package name is prefixed with `coderoad-` to limit package registry cluttering.

Have an [NPM account](https://www.npmjs.com/signup) before running publish.

    > npm publish


### Promoting your Tutorial

As CodeRoad is a new project, there is not yet a place to display tutorials. If you create something for CodeRoad please send an email to coderoadapp@gmail.com, or tweet at @coderoadapp.
