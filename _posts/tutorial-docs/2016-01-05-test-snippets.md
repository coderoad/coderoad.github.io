Test Runners may have pre-made [Atom snippets](https://atom.io/docs/latest/using-atom-snippets) to quickly generate test files. See [*mocha-coderoad* snippets](https://github.com/coderoad/mocha-coderoad/blob/master/snippets.cson) as an example.

* Open up *Atom* -> *Open Your Snippets*.
* Add the contents of *snippets.cson* to your global *snippets.cson* file.
* Read the test runner README to see which snippets are available and which prefixes you should use.

For example, typing the snippet `mochacr-f` will generate an entire set of tests for a *mocha-coderoad* function. See an example:
