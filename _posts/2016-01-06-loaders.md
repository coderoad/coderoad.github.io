Tutorials may be written in different programming languages or for different compilers, so there isn't yet a standard way to load data from user created files. Instead, test runners can determine the standard way, allowing for options for different transpiled languages.

We'll use `mocha-coderoad` as the example below to see how `loadEditor` & `loadGlobal` are used.

#### loadEditor

```js
loadEditor('current-file.js');
```

This command will load the given project file within your tests. s

#### loadGlobal

```js
loadGlobal('data', 'data/file.json');
```

This will attach `data` to the global scope inside of Atom. Be very careful not to over-write existing globals.
