Test Runners may have pre-made [Atom snippets](https://atom.io/docs/latest/using-atom-snippets) to quickly generate test files. See [*mocha-coderoad* snippets](https://github.com/coderoad/mocha-coderoad/blob/master/snippets.cson) as an example.

Open up *Atom* -> *Open Your Snippets*. Add the contents of `snippets.cson` to your global `snippets.cson` file. Read the project README to see which snippets are available and which prefixes you should use. For example: 'mochacr-f' for testing a "mocha-coderoad" function.
